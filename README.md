### Welcome to Python Discord Summer Code Jam 2020!

#### The theme for this code jam is **Early Internet**.

What you do with this theme or how you interpret it is up to you, but it will be your task to come up with something fun using this theme.

#### The chosen technology for this game jam is [Django](https://djangoapp.com/).

Django is a high-level Python Web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design. It comes "batteries included" with a slew of incredibly polished features, including database migrations, an excellent CRM, access control, security features to prevent you from making expensive mistakes, and probably the best documentation on the internet.

#### We expect you to write a webapp.

Your project should be a webapp that can run in the browser. In order to do this, you'll need to use Django as your backend, and create some sort of frontend.

This may seem daunting at first, but please consider the following:
- We will only review your Python code. Your frontend code is not subject to review.
- You are welcome to make use of CSS frameworks, SPA frameworks with plug & play components, or any other tools that will do all the frontend visuals for you. We don't expect you to write CSS or JavaScript from scratch, and you will get no bonus points for doing so.

A very easy way to get a website looking good without having to write any "frontend code" is to use a CSS framework such as [Bulma](https://bulma.io/), [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) or [UIKit](https://getuikit.com/). If you want to make it really simple, you can even use [django-simple-bulma](https://github.com/python-discord/django-simple-bulma), a PyPI package we've created to easily get Bulma running on your Django application.

These frameworks all have excellent documentation, and usually allow you to just copy paste elements you like from the documentation and into your application. **You do not need to be good at visual design or aesthetics in order to use these frameworks, it's really just programming.**

## Getting Started

### 1. Fork this repository

Start by [forking this repository](https://github.com/python-discord/summer-code-jam-2020/fork). If you're working as a team, only one person needs to do this.

### 2. Create a team folder in the repo

You should come up with some team name, and then create a folder in the root of this repository with your team name. **All your project files must be contained within your team's subdirectory**. If you make any changes to files other than those in your team folder, we will not be able to merge your PR, and may have to disqualify your submission.

### 3. Study the guides and guidelines

We have written several documents that you should read through if you haven't done so already. These can all be accessed from the sidebar on [the main event page on our website](https://pythondiscord.com/pages/code-jams/code-jam-7/). The most important pages to work through can be found here:

- [Rules](#)
- [Judging](https://pythondiscord.com/pages/code-jams/judging/)

### 4. Create a pull request

Open a pull request from your fork's `master` to the `master` branch of this repository in order to submit your project. **You should use the name of your team as the name of the pull request.**

### 5. Commit to your master branch

The pull request you created will be automatically updated whenever you push code to `master` on your fork, so you can create the pull request whenever you want and you only have to do it once. You do not need to wait until the very end of the game jam before you do it. Just keep pushing code to your `master` branch and do your best to finish before the game jam ends!

If you are working as a team, you should consider learning about feature branches so that you don't all work directly on the `master` branch and cause each other a bunch of conflicts. For a short explanation of how this works, see [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7YDbrS9I48).
